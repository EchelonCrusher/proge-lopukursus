--- RPG Snake ---

DESCRIPTION
RPG Snake is, as the name suggests, a Snake game with RPG (role-playing game) elements. It is developed by two people.
The game features you, the typical hungry snake on an atypical herbivore diet; several enemies that are set out to cut
you in half, some wild fireballs and a very powerful adversary.

HOW TO PLAY
You can control the direction of the snake using the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT). Don't fear the walls, for they
let you through with no hassle.

INSTALLATION
Since it's made in pygame, just install the game archive's ZIP, unzip and run scratch.py with Python.
